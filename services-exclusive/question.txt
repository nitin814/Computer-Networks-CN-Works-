S is a super server process which supposes to offer four services S1,S2,S3,S4 by 
listening to four socket fds. As soon as the first client connects to S1, the server process
forks a child process and the child process will handle the client request and also
listen to any other client who comes for the same service.So the super server no longer
listens on port where S1 was supposed. The parent process will continue to listen to 
the other three socket fds. 

---> Simple, have four sfds binded to four different ports
---> Listen to all the four ports
---> As soon as a client connects to any of the port, fork a child process
--->In the child process, close all the other three ports and handle the client request
---> In the parent process, close the port which the client connected to and continue to listen to the other three ports

--port reuse and shit
